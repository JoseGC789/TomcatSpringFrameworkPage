# TomcatSpringFrameworkPage

<p>
Mini-project that I'm writing while learning how to develop microservices with Tomcat and Spring Framework (without Boot) 
as a way to expand my knowledge on Spring and teach me (and everyone else reading this repository) how older Spring 
applications used to be developed. Hopefully with this, I will learn more about the inner workings of Spring which will
help me maintain the legacy code at work.
